# Overview

A microscopic, single-room chat server for use on assessments. Does not store code or messages, nor does it log access
attempts. Could easily be made to do authentication too, if so desired. 

# Usage:

Simply run `python srv.py`, which will load `index.html` into memory, to be served at `/`. Uses [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org) as
a web framework.
